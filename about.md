Hello there! My name is Atharva Vaidya. I am a Software Engineer specializing in apps for all Apple platforms (macOS, iOS, tvOS, watchOS). Currently, I work at [Journi](https://www.journiapp.com) as an iOS Engineer.


In terms of programming languages, I am most proficient currently with **[Swift](https://developer.apple.com/swift/)**, **[Objective-C](https://developer.apple.com/library/mac/documentation/Cocoa/Conceptual/ProgrammingWithObjectiveC/Introduction/Introduction.html)**, and, **[C++](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C%2B%2B)**, and somewhat proficient with **[Python](https://www.python.org/)**. I have minimal experience with NodeJS, Electron, and React Native.
