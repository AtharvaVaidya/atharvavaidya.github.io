Hiya! I'm Atharva. I started this website to pen down my thoughts on Swift, and my journey in becoming a full-time iOS engineer. Since I started writing this blog, I've worked at a bunch of different companies across 3 continents and 7 different countries. I currently live in the beautiful city of Lisbon, Portugal ðŸ‡µðŸ‡¹. 

I intend to use this website from now on as an outlet for my thoughts and ideas. Things that I think need to be put out in the world.

Some companies I've worked at:
