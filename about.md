My name is Atharva Vaidya. I write software and play soccer.

In terms of programming languages, I am most proficient currently with **[C++][c-link]**, **[Objective-C][objc-link]**, and **[Swift][swift-link]**, and somewhat proficient with **[Python][python-link]**.



My GitHub username is [atharvavaidya][az-gh-link], and my Twitter username is also [@atharva_vaidya][az-tw-link]. You can find me on LinkedIn [here][az-li-link]. My email: [contact@atharva.me][mailto:contact@atharva.me].
