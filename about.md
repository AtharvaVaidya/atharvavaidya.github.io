Hello there! My name is Atharva Vaidya. I am a Software Engineer specializing in apps for all Apple platforms (macOS, iOS, tvOS, watchOS). Currently I am looking for a job and I'm happy to relocate to any part of the world.


In terms of programming languages, I am most proficient currently with **[Swift](https://developer.apple.com/swift/)**, **[Objective-C](https://developer.apple.com/library/mac/documentation/Cocoa/Conceptual/ProgrammingWithObjectiveC/Introduction/Introduction.html)**, and, **[C++](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C%2B%2B)**, and somewhat proficient with **[Python](https://www.python.org/)**. I have minimal experience with NodeJS, Electron, and React Native.


My GitHub username is [atharvavaidya](https://github.com/atharvavaidya/), and my Twitter username is [@atharva_vaidya](https://twitter.com/atharva_vaidya). You can find me on LinkedIn [here](https://www.linkedin.com/in/atharvavaidya). My email: [contact@atharva.co](mailto:contact@atharva.co).
